## Adapting Automatic Speech Recognition to Dysarthric Speech

**Folders:**
* deep-speech: code to split the data into train/validation/test sets & modifications made to the Deep Speech inference.py file to perform evaluation on the UASpeech dataset
* encoder-decoder: code to build and evaluate an encoder-decoder recurrent neural network
* exploratory-data-analysis: different plots exploring the UASpeech dataset
* freeze: modifications made to certain Deep Speech files to achieve layer freezing
* plots: creation of dissertation plots
